<h1>Developmental Timeline: AI & Cloud Computing</h1>

<body>The rate of evolution of digital innovation is becoming exponential. The new industrial age is here, and this time it is not the steam and steel of the mid-18th century, but the algorithms and data of the 21st century. The birth of the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Alan Turing’s era of the 1950s, and its transformational research from academic circles to breakthrough practical use, took a relatively short time. It was just a decade ago that the innovation to transfer, save and protect data from on-premise to the “cloud” became mainstream through Cloud Computing. Tech giants like Amazon (Amazon Web Services), Google  (Google Cloud Platform), Microsoft ( Microsoft Azure), etc, seized this opportunity and innovated in this new tech field.</body>
