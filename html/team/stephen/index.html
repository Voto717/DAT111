<h1>Artificial Intelligence and Cloud Computing</h1>
<h2>A Symbiotic Relationship</h2>
<h3>By Stephen Fuh(DAT111-HVL)</h3>

<p>The symbiotic relationship between Cloud Computing and AI  is more of a mutual technological need for one another than just convenience. The cloud provides the resources on which modern AI taps, and operates at a global scale. Cloud Computing is, therefore, the means through which resources needed by the AI ecosystem are powered. 
The AI revolution and its demand in this contemporary context are enormous. We are in an era where complex, rule-based algorithms are utilised in building sophisticated, large language models (LLMs) of neural networks with billions of parameters to enable deep learning, which powers AI.
</p>
<p>To train these models, enormous quantities of data and computational power are needed. Petabytes of data, weeks of processing time on clusters of thousands of specialised, expensive Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) or Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), are required for training a top-notch LLM (Kumar et al., 2024) . 
The capital cost for building and maintaining such an infrastructure is challenging for large corporations, not to mention a single company or organisation (Cottier et al., 2024). Cloud Computing seamlessly provide a solution for such a challenge, acting as a go-to democratiser of AI.
